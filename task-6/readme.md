When I read this task for the first time, I got confused for 2 things. Firstly What is **Go** and what is **Geddit** . I became terrified and searched for these 2 things in Google. It was untill my cousin told me to read the question properly. After I read the question properly I understood the essence of the question, but still didnt had any idea on how to proceed. After which i referred to the Github repository where I gone through what is Geddit and how to automate the process we need. Since i didnt know Go language , I took long time to understand the syntax of this language. To be frank I heavily realied on this [example code](https://github.com/vartanbeno/go-reddit/blob/master/examples/get-top-posts/main.go) which was more similar to this task. Even though I followed the instructions given, I wasnt able to get the required output and got many errors which i wasnt able to understand properly. Thats why I have decided to push all the work I have done to the Tasks repository.
