As for pset-0 (ie Scratch Project) , I understood the basics of Scratch through Google , after which i solved the problem.

I first learned the basic syntax of C which is  required to solve the problem sets . Since they also gave the instructions on how to proceed i really enjoyed the first few problem sets. As for rest of the problems it may take some time  to figure it out.
