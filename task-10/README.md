As for pset-0 ie Scratch Project , I watched and understood the basics through Google , after which i found it quite easy to solve  the problem.

As I followed the instructions given by CS50 I found the terminal commands used in cs50 IDE terminal were much similar to linux terminal with commands like cd , ls and so on. I first understood the basic syntax for C language after i could do the problems.
As for rest of the problems it may take some time  it seems!
