## About Myself
My name is R.Srikesh. I was born and brought up in Chennai. I completed my entire school life at Amrita Vidyalayam, Chennai. I am coming from Non CS background.
I love Maths and wish to improve myself in the field of Data Science and will work hard to achieve that and I truly believe that joining amFOSS  will help me to achieve that. Another reason as to why I need to join amFOSS is to improve my programming skills and learn new technologies.
