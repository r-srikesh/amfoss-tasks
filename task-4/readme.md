Since I started learning Programmming recently, I found this task quite challenging, Particularly learning the basics of Java. At first when I saw the code, I got terrified 
on learning that i need to debug this code. Since I use VS-Code , I debugged the errors due to missing **;** and **()** . After then I read the condition given in the
amFOSS document, where it was said **+** and * are reversed.  Thankfully the code was well commented which helped me to find the part where arithmetic operation take place and correct them.
There were also 2 else conditions in the calculation part which I think was unnecessary (not so sure) and small errors like spelling error of **Multiply**, opposite placement of Start in Stop function and Stop in Start Function. After which errors were increasing on a factor of 23
and Correct answer were decreasing at the factor of 1. Even though It took a huge chunk of time, I enjoyed the process,
